# Continuous Clicker Script

This Python script uses the `pynput` and `pyautogui` libraries to simulate continuous left mouse clicks when the "Delete" key is pressed. It runs in the background and can be toggled on/off by pressing the "Delete" key.

## Features

- **Automatic Clicker**: Hold the "Delete" key to simulate continuous left mouse clicks.
- **Toggle On/Off**: Press the "Delete" key to activate or deactivate the automatic clicking.
- **Multithreaded**: The script uses threading to ensure smooth clicking without freezing the main application.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pynput pyautogui
```

How It Works
The script listens for the "Delete" key press using the pynput library.
When the "Delete" key is pressed, the script starts simulating continuous mouse clicks by holding down the left mouse button with pyautogui.mouseDown().
It toggles the continuous clicking when the "Delete" key is pressed again.
